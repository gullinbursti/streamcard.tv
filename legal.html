								MODD is fully committed to your privacy. We created this Privacy Policy to help protect your information and assure you that it’s only being used to provide you with the highest quality of services. We value your trust, which is why we’re committed to providing exceptional service in a secure environment.
		<br><br>
								The information MODD collects
		<br><br>
								At MODD, we’re constantly looking for ways to improve our offerings and develop new features that our users find valuable. In order to do so, we collect information to help us analyze behavior and interests so that we can continue to make MODD better.
		<br><br>
								As a general visitor to the site, you may browse our site to find more information about our offerings. You are not required to provide us with any personally identifiable information as a visitor. However, we do automatically receive information from your browser or mobile device, including the name of the website from which you came to came to the MODD website, as well as which website you’re going to when you leave. This information also includes the IP address of the computer/server that you use to access the Internet, your Internet Service Provide name, web browser type, type of mobile device, computer operating system, pages accessed, and other similar information. We use all of this information to look at trends and to help us improve our offerings.
		<br><br>
								As a user, you maybe be required to provide us with personally identifiable information. We are the sole owners of any information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us during sign up, or that is passed through our platform as part of the user experience. We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and other sources, such as information from the Twitch service through the Twitch API.
		<br><br>
								How MODD uses information

		<br><br>					We use the information we receive in a variety of ways, the core of which is to improve MODD. We may also use this information to maintain our services; to customize our service to meet your needs; to process transactions and donations; to collect fees or other charges; to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent transactions; to provide customer support; and to contact you.
		<br><br>
								Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services and other information we believe you’d find valuable.
		<br><br>
								When MODD shares information

		<br><br>
								Our policy is to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of individuals except in cases when the law requires disclosure or when we have your permission to do so. Occasionally, we may share aggregated statistics of user behavior (e.g. usage patterns, donation trends, user growth, etc.) with our partners and other interested parties. This information will never identify any individual personally or contain any personally identifiable information.
		<br><br>
								MODD does not sell, lease, share, rent, or otherwise provide any personally identifiable information for marketing purposes to any companies or persons outside of MODD. We may provide your personally identifiable information to service providers and affiliates that provide services in conjunction with our offerings, such as payment processors, fraud protection services, or other parties assisting in improving MODD. Information is securely transmitted to these affiliates, and such affiliates will only receive information necessary to provide their respective services and will be bound by confidentiality agreements limiting the use of such information. Please be aware that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display in any public location through the use of our platform becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others.
		<br><br>
								MODD will only disclose personally identifiable information to government officials and law enforcement agencies when it is required by law (e.g. in compliance with a subpoena or court order) or if we believe in good faith that such action is appropriate and necessary to protect and defend the rights of MODD, or to protect the safety of MODD users, employees, affiliates, and the general public.
		<br><br>
								In the event that MODD or some or all assets related to our services are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign any information we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
		<br><br>
								Your access to and control over information
					
								<br><br>

								If desired, you may decline to share your personal information with MODD, at which time we will no longer be able to provide you with a majority of the functionality of our offerings. If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information, you may contact us at support@modd.live. Please note that in order to protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making any changes to your personal information.
		<br><br>
								Links
					
								<br><br>

								The MODD website contains links to other sites that are not under our direct control. Please note that the MODD Privacy Policy does not apply to these sites and MODD is not responsible for, nor do we endorse, the privacy practices or the content of these sites. You should check the individual privacy policies of these sites to understand how they will utilize your personal information.
		<br><br>
								Third-Party Providers and Do Not Track<br><br>

								MODD may use third-party Web analytics services on our site, such as Google Analytics, to analyze how people use MODD. Information collected by such technologies will be disclosed to or collected by these services providers, who use this information to evaluate your use of MODD. You may choose to opt out of their services if you do not wish to have your information collected by them.
		<br><br>
								Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web brosers. DNT is a way for users to tell websites and services that they do not want certain information about their visits collected. We currently do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals at this time though, as the Internet industry is currently working towards accepted standardization and practices around DNT.
		<br><br>
								Data Security<br><br>

								MODD has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your information. While we take precautions to protect sensitive information that’s transmitted online, we also protect your information offline . Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job, such as billing or customer service, are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/serves in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
		<br><br>
								Please note that while we continually make every effort to implement safeguards to protect your personal information, the very nature of the Internet makes it impossible to guarantee the security of transmitted data. MODD makes no warranties or representations as to the security and confidentiality of any data you transmit. Any data you transmit to MODD is at your own risk, and we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
		<br><br>
								Privacy of children<br><br>

								If you are under the age of 18, please make sure that you provide your personally identifiable information only after obtaining parental consent. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use or access MODD at any time or in any manner. We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years of age. If MODD learns that personal information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent of a child under 13 who has been using MODD, please contact us at support@modd.live to have that child’s account remove and information deleted.
		<br><br>
								Application of privacy policy<br><br>

								For users visiting MODD from the European Economic Area or other non-US territories, please note that any data that passes through MODD will be transferred outside the European Economic Area or those other non-US territories for use by MODD and our affiliates for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. By providing data to MODD, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United States or other countries, except in the case of data transfers from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, which are covered under our EU-US and Swiss-US Safe Harbor Certifications detailed below. For users from outside the US, Switzerland, or the European Economic Area, pelase note that las in the US may not provide the same level of information protection as the laws of the user’s country of residence.
		<br><br>
								MODD also adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. In compliance with such policies, MODD is committed to addressing and resolving any complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. For all inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy, including European Union or Swiss citizens, please first contact MODD at support@modd.live.
		<br><br>
								How MODD uses cookies<br><br>

								Like many other sites on the Internet, MODD uses cookies—small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. MODD uses cookies and collects IP addresses and other automatically collected information in order to better facilitate the services provided to you, and to collect non-personal aggregate data for marketing and research purposes. If you accept the cookies used on our site, we may be able to identify your system by reading the cookie stored on your system, but we will not be able to identify you unless you’ve entered your personal information.
		<br><br>
								We may also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information from you when you visit our website or use our services.
		<br><br>
								Changes to Privacy Policy<br><br>

								We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. You should review this Privacy Policy frequently. If we make significant changes to this policy, we may notify you through a blog post, by email, or by any method we determine at our discretion. If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately at support@modd.live.
		<br><br>
								Contact Information<br><br>

								Questions about the MODD Privacy Policy can be sent to support@modd.live.<br><br>
								
								This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") explains how information (both customer and end user information) is collected and utilized by MODD, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies ("MODD", "our", or "we"). This Privacy Policy applies to the websites provided by MODD, including without limitation, www.MODD.com (the "Sites") and MODD's online services ("Online Services"). "You", "your", or "customer" refers to our customers. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Online Services. If you have any concerns about privacy, please send an email to privacy@modd.live. <br><br>
								1. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION<br><br>
								Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and improve the Online Services, to Add Cardister and assist you with your Online Services account, and to provide you with a better experience with the Online Services. We store and process information in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to provide information to us and/or enable us to collect information from your end users, you hereby consent to the transfer of such information to the United States and represent and warrant that you have obtained all required end user consents.<br><br>
								Registration: During the registration process on our Sites, you may be asked for certain information, which may include your name, your email address, the company for which you work, your country, and a password. This registration information is used to validate customers when they visit the Sites. It may also be used to send you additional promotional information about our services. If you were entered in a MODD promotion in connection with your registration, we will also use your name and email address to contact you if you have won a prize in that promotion, and will ask you for the address at which you would like to receive your prize. We store all data associated with your account, including your contact information, your applications and your campaigns.<br><br>
								Cookies and Beacons: A "cookie" is a small text file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that may be used at the MODD Sites: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your computer and remains in this "Cookies" folder after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer's memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. The Sites may also use Web beacons (also called "clear GIFs" or "pixel tags") in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page. If you have arrived at the Sites by clicking on a banner ad for one of our products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an identification number for the ad that you clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the Sites that you were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps MODD determine which of our ads attract the most visitors. If, after you arrive at our Sites, you choose to request further information from us about our products and services, the information that you provide in that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie. This also helps MODD measure the effectiveness of our advertising. Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser. MODD Sites may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity at the Sites to better understand how the Sites are used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your experience at the Sites. We may use a third-party email technology to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the effectiveness of our advertising. In addition, MODD may serve ads on the Sites using our own ad serving technology. In doing so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your computer and will use information about your browser and your activity at the Sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie.<br><br>
								Services: When an ad is served through our Online Services, we may collect the following from your end users' devices: bundle ID, language ID, operating system version, device model, software developer kit (SDK) version, unique device identifier, IP address, and Media Access Control (MAC) address. In addition, when an end user accesses a video ad, we may collect additional stats about videos and video playback such as: start/boot-up information, amount played/session length information, memory on device used for our video cache, videos cached on a device and complete view event. We identify an end user’s device using MODD’s internal device ID, which is linked to an end user’s IDFA (Apple) or Advertiser ID (Android). We may associate an IDFA or Advertiser ID with other persistent device identifiers (for example, IDFA, Advertiser ID, or MAC address) at any time. The additional information we access and collect may determine the nature of the ad that the end user sees. For example, we use the IP address to create a country code to help advertisers target advertising campaigns by country. We may generate a cookie based on a device identifier or use other technologies to record information about the ads an end user is shown, as well as the ads an end user clicks and other actions the end user takes within the application. We share device identifiers and a hash of the MAC address with advertisers so that they can track average revenue per user (ARPU) and life time value (LTV) for the end users they acquire through the advertisements. All of the information we collect about your end users is presented to you through a dashboard (accessible through your account) including information analyzed by our analytics service (currently provided by a third party). You cannot access data about the end users of another customer through the Online Services.<br><br>
								If you use MODD’s Post-Install Tools, which include Post-Install Analytics, Retargeting and Newsfeed, we may access and collect data such as the following (“Post-Install Data”): when an end user launches the app, how long the end user plays the app, and IAP data. We may use this information to provide you with lifetime value (LTV) calculations, advertising campaign optimizations, and user re-targeting based on a user’s usage patterns.<br><br>
								2. INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE<br><br>
								In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of the service that you have requested or to assist us in analyzing our service or information collected about you and/or your end users, MODD may provide your information and/or your end user information to such third party, or such third party may collect information from you or the end users on our behalf. We may share your information and end user information with third parties with whom we have a strategic relationship, such as advertisers. The information shared with these third parties may be used for industry analysis, tracking ad conversions or demographic profiling. We may also provide your information and end user information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods and services we believe will be of interest to you. We will disclose any information about you or your end users to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of MODD or any third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. In addition, we may disclose information to third parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Finally, we may share aggregate or anonymous information about you or your end users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.<br><br>
								3. PRIVACY POLICIES<br><br>
								All MODD customers that display ads through the Online Services must comply with all applicable laws and post a privacy policy that discloses the customer's use of services like MODD and the information such services collect, store and use. All customers must ensure that they have end user consent to use our Online Services and for MODD to collect, use and store end user data. We are not responsible for your use of end user data or the use of end user data by third party advertising networks you use with the Online Services. End users should review your privacy policies for information about your data practices.<br><br>
								4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY<br><br>
								While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to your data will not occur; we make good faith efforts to prevent such occurrences. We do not warrant or represent that your account or any of your information or end user information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.
								5. COMMUNICATIONS<br><br>
								It is our policy to provide communications, whether such communications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our customers via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our Sites, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers.<br><br>
								6. CHILDREN<br><br>
								The Online Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. Customers must not use our Online Services to provide advertisements to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our files.<br><br>
								7. DO NOT TRACK<br><br>
								Because the websites we operate do not collect or use the type of information that is generally subject to your browser’s “Do Not Track” (DNT) privacy preference, our websites do not look for this signal from your browser. Your DNT settings, however, may affect the third-party services we use.<br><br>
								8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY<br><br>
								We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion. Any such changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" date above.<br><br>
								9. CONTACT<br><br>
								If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@modd.live.

													<br><br>

													This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between You and MODD, Inc. ("MODD"), and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings with respect to the content, products or services provided by MODD (the "Online Services"), and the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended at any time by MODD without specific notice to You. The latest Agreement will be posted on MODD.com (the "Site"), and You should review this Agreement prior to using the Site or the Online Services.
													1. Description of Online Services. If you are a publisher during the Online Services Term (as defined below), MODD will serve to You advertisements provided by third party advertisers ("Online Services Ad(s)"), for display on the app(s) which use the Online Services ("Online Services App(s)"), based upon the criteria selected by You and/or Your advertisers via the protocol and/or user interface provided by MODD for accessing the Online Services. This protocol and/or user interface may be updated by MODD from time to time without notice to you ("Online Services Interface"). If you are an advertiser during the Online Services Term, you will provide Online Services Ads for display on the Online Services Apps.
													2. Implementation of Online Services. You will implement the Online Services in a manner that complies with the technical and implementation requirements provided on the Site or in writing by MODD to You from time to time, including those instructions contained in the documentation regarding the Online Services Interface.

													<br><br>
													a) Online Services Obligations.

In addition, for any video ad request You must provide statistics about videos and video playback required by MODD such as: start/bootup information, cancel, amount played/session length information, memory on device used for our video cache, videos cached on a device and complete view event. In addition, You or Your selected third-party attribution platform must notify MODD when an application is opened by the user. Advertisers must be pre-approved in writing in order to use third-party attribution data ("Attribution Data"). Attribution Data includes all sessions for the applicable app, as well as attributed installs to MODD. You will be solely responsible for all, without limitation, Online Services Ad content, Online Services Ad information, Attribution Data, Online Services Ad URLs, editorial, text, graphic, audiovisual, and other content and any other information You enter into the Online Services, whether generated by or for You ("Online Services Data"). You will protect any Online Services accounts, usernames or passwords and take full responsibility for Your own, and third party, use of any Online Services accounts, usernames or passwords. You will obtain MODD's prior written consent (to include email) for any third party use of the Online Services except for (i) a third party's use solely to provide analytics information for Your Apps and (ii) a bona fide advertising agency's use.

													3. Online Services Term. This Agreement will be effective as of the date MODD activates Your Online Services account and will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement (the "Online Services Term"). You may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, at any time by sending written notice of Your desire to cancel Your participation in the Online Services to modd@modd.live. This Agreement will be deemed terminated within ten (10) business days of MODDʼs receipt of Your notice. If You violate this Agreement, MODD may in its sole discretion, without notice, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate the participation of Your Online Services App in all or part of the Online Services. In addition, MODD may terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate the participation of Your Online Services App in all or part of the Online Services, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days’ prior notice.<br><br>
													4. Online Services Advertiser Obligations. You will be solely responsible for all matters related to Your third party advertisers who provide advertisements to You in connection with the Online Services ("Online Services Advertisers"), including without limitation the solicitation and trafficking of Online Services Ads, billing and payment of Online Services Advertisers, providing all technical support services to Online Services Advertisers, and handling all other inquiries and disputes of any type or nature.<br><br>
						
						
													5. Online Services Fee. Some of the services in the Online Services require payment of fees. MODD reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon thirty (30) days’ prior notice to You, which may be sent by email or posted on the Site. If You are an advertiser, You will pre-pay all applicable fees, as described on the Site. If You are an advertiser and choose to run a Cost Per Install ("CPI") campaign without having properly integrated either the MODD SDK or a valid server-to-server connection, You will be charged $0.04 per click for all the clicks delivered in that campaign, and the campaign will be automatically terminated when detected. Impressions and clicks are tracked instantly. Installs are tracked whenever a user opens the application they have downloaded. When using the SDK, MODD will keep the install loop open for a period of 21 days. During this time, installs will still be reported for campaigns that might be off (not displaying any new impressions) but the advertiser will still be accountable for the install and the publisher will be paid for installs coming from clicks that they delivered in the past. This only affects CPI campaigns, not Cost Per Click ("CPC"). Fees for video ads will be on a Cost Per Completed View ("CPCV") basis. If You are an advertiser, you must make a minimum bid as listed on the MODD dashboard. Fees for MODD’s Retargeting tool will be on a CPC basis.<<br><br>
						
													6. License to Online Services Interface. MODD grants to You a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive and non-sublicensable license during the Online Services Term to use the Online Services Interface solely for the purpose of transmitting Online Services Requests and other required information and receiving Online Services Results Sets solely to the extent permitted hereunder. Except to the limited extent expressly provided in this Agreement, MODD does not grant, and You will not acquire, any right, title or interest (including, without limitation, any implied license) in or to any MODD intellectual property rights; and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to MODD.<br><br>

In addition, MODD may use any content used with the Online Services in any form of publicity.<br><br>
