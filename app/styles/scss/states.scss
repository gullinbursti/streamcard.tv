/**
 * states.scss
 *
 * States describe how modules or layouts look in particular states and override all other styles.
 * This file contains global state rules.  Module specific states will be found in the module files.
 * States generally imply a javascript dependency which applies the state classes to the elements.
 * The state styles can describe how a module looks on varous screen sizes, or from different views.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - State class names should begin with "is_" prefix (ie ".is-selected")
 *   - States are built to stand alone and generally use only a single class selector
 *   - Use of !important is acceptable in this file (but only use it when necessary)
 *   - States speficic to modules should not be defined here.  They belong in the module files.
